The project has two parts: 
1. C++
    - C++ section will contain folders of all the data structures and algorithms topics with some pre-addressed questions. 
    - Participants can solve problems and send pull requests. Participants can even add questions and solutions of their interest.
    - There will be a technical writing section in which participants can contribute their technical writing on any topic of c++ and data structures.
    - The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general-purpose languages - C++.
    - Well-documented source code with detailed explanations provides a valuable resource for educators and students alike.

2. The webpage- 
    - There shall be showcasing Daily tasks from Day 1 to Day 60. 
    - And a section to showcase technical writings of participants in the form of blogs
